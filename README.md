sgte: a simple Erlang Template Engine
=====================================
sgte is an Erlang template Engine for generating structured output (code, html web pages, xml, emails, csv files, etc...).

It's inspired on the [StringTemplate](http://www.stringtemplate.org/) template language. And tries to enforce strict separation between model and view. The template language tries to remain as simple as possible. 

An overview of sgte and how to use it can be found here:
